# Plan-Path-for-a-Differential-Drive-Robot-in-Simulink
This GitHub repository provides an implementation demonstrating obstacle-free path planning between two locations on a given map using SimulinkÂ®. It employs a probabilistic road map (PRM) planning algorithm (mobileRobotPRM) to generate the path and utilizes the Pure Pursuit controller block to generate control commands for navigation
